            From Cheap Threads to Bold Vision: Nathan's Story

            Hi. It's Nathan, from White Caps.

            One day I was getting ready for school during sophomore year, but then I realized one thing: I didn't like how I looked.
            Growing up, I mostly wore hand-me-downs from my siblings or cheap clothes that didn't feel like "me". In my childhood environment, 
            I was taught that spending money on clothes wasn't practical and that it wouldn't bring lasting happiness.

            But as I was shaping my identity in highschool, I realized that clothes mean so much more just something to cover your body.
            They're a form of self-expression, a symbol for self-love, and a core of my personality. I wanted to wear something that brought
            me joy everytime I put it on. Therefore,  I did some expermentation with different outfits and a range of brands from Uniqlo 
            and No Boundaries (Walmart).

            It wasn’t just about finding a style that suited me — it was about finding a purpose. 
            I started noticing the impact the fashion industry was having on the planet, and it struck me hard.
             I began learning more about the environmental damage caused by fast fashion brands with pollution and waste. 
             The more I discovered, the more It pmo and I felt the urge to make a change. So that's when I decided to do it myself.
             I knew with my partner Rehan and the support I had from my friends and family, I could build something of my own:
             a brand that not only helped people discover their style, but also fought back against the sins of the fashion industry.

          One afternoon, my cousins and I went to a beach in India—a place my family had always loved to go.
          I remember as a kid when I visited the beach, I was always filled with excitement as the beach was a place
          to explore a new world. It was a world abundant of color where you could see a never-ending landscape of blue with breathtaking creatures
          from colorful fish to an angry crab. However, when I visited this beach in India I noticed that
          The sand was black and soft, unlike the pale, coarse sand of the beaches I’d seen in the U.S. 
           As we walked along the shore, my excitement turned into concern. The beach wasn’t full of the life I valued as a childhood.

          The shore littered with plastic, tangled fishing nets, and the worst of all—dead fish.
           Dozens of them. Some small, some big, their lifeless bodies lying in the sand, their scales dull and eyes clouded over.
           I wanted to believe this was just one bad spot, a random case of pollution that could be cleaned up, but the truth was, this was normal.
            The ocean—the thing I had always imagined as vast, powerful, and untouchable—was sick. And we were the ones making it that way.

          When I came home in Allen, I couldn’t shake what I had seen.
           If I saw someone toss trash out of their car or litter a bottole of the ground,
           I thought of that beach.
            It made me realize how easy it was to ignore problems when they weren’t right in front of us.
          
          I already knew and heard about the microplastics, oil spills, and how industries dump waste directly into the water growing up.
          But I never did anything about it. 
          This is the time I do.

          That trip to India changed the way I saw the world. 
          It made me realize how connected we all are to the planet, whether we think about it or not. And even though I’m just one person, I don’t want to be the kind of person who sees a problem and looks away.
          Nathan and I don’t have all the answers yet, but we’re not giving up. 
          One way or another, we’re going to find a way to help clean the oceans—because if no one tries, nothing changes.
